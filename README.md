## Usage
To view the countdown and wishes, download the index.html file and open it in a web browser.
You can change the `name`, `startCountDate` and `weddingDate` variables to match them to your needs.
And don't forget to send the file to the couple:)
Here is an example of a letter to the bride:
###### When's the big wedding day? ðŸ¤”
###### Weâ€™re so excited and counting down the days!
###### Every single moment is precious, and we can't wait to share in the joy of this beautiful celebration together!  
###### Donâ€™t forget to download the attached file and open it for a little surprise!  
###### Each day, just click on your name in the title to see what fun awaits you! :)  
###### Congratulations, beautiful bride! Weâ€™re thrilled for you!  <br/>
###### ðŸ˜ƒðŸ¤©ðŸ‘°ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜ƒ
